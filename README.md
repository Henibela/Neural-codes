# Neural-codes

A code repository for neural network exercises based on the book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) by Michael Nielsen.

## About

This repository contains code implementations and exercises from Michael Nielsen's online book on neural networks and deep learning. It serves as a learning journey through the fundamentals of neural networks, including:

- Perceptrons and sigmoid neurons
- Backpropagation algorithm
- Improving neural network learning
- Deep learning techniques

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters and exercises from the book:

```
Neural-codes/
├── chapter1/          # Introduction to neural networks
├── chapter2/          # How backpropagation works
├── chapter3/          # Improving neural networks
├── chapter4/          # Deep learning
└── experiments/       # Additional experiments and variations
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- (Additional dependencies will be added as needed)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Henibela/Neural-codes.git
cd Neural-codes

# Install dependencies (when available)
# pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Resources

- [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) - The main book by Michael Nielsen
- [GitHub Repository for the book](https://github.com/mnielsen/neural-networks-and-deep-learning)

## License

This project is for educational purposes, following along with Michael Nielsen's book.

## Progress

Exercises and implementations will be added progressively as I work through the book.
